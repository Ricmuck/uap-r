=========
An implementation of [tobie's ua-parser](http://www.uaparser.org/) in R and C++

Installation
=====
Install uaparser through:

>devtools::install_github("ua-parser/uap-r")

Then place <code>regexes.yaml</code>
from the [uap-core](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) repository in the installation directory. In the event
that you don't complete this step, the uaparser will attempt to download the YAML file into a temporary directory
when called, but this is less efficient and not workable for machines without a direct internet connection.
